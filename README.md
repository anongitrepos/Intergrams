This repository contains the implementation of Intergrams in C++ along with a number of other experimental versions. `compute_ngrams_full` is the implementation of the Intergrams algorithm. This implementation supports the paper: "Intermediate N-Gramming: Deterministic and Fast N-Grams For Large N and Large Datasets".

To build, modify the `Makefile` to set the include and library paths correctly.  You need to have the Armadillo library installed and available (it is used for timing).
